Tech Exeter Conference - the multi-disciplinary, grassroots tech conference returns, with its inclusive, community ethos, and friendly, welcoming vibe.

This year weâ€™re running three conference tracks (ranging from the not-so-technical through to the hardcore developer track), hot food catering, plus new for 2018, workshops.

Topics include: Artificial Intelligence, Amazon Alexa, Blockchain, Data Science, Javascript, HTML5, LoRaWAN, Machine Learning, Robotics, Systems and Networks Engineering, Unit Testing and more!
