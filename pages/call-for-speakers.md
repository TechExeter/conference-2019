Our call for speakers is **now open**, and we'd love to hear from you!

Our focus for this year's tech conference is around **Security** and **Hacking**.

{: .notice--info} 
**For example:** *"Will quantum computers break encryption?" "How to keep wordpress sites safe from hackers" "How to do cloud deployment securely" "Accepting user input - coding defensively" "Hacking smarthome devices" "Top 10 tips for stopping cyber-crime"*

Some notes

  * You don't need to have spoken at a conference before
  * We welcome non-technical talks, but our focus is science / tech / engineering / art / math (STEAM)
  * Returning speakers are welcome
  * You can submit multiple talks
  * If you have a talk that isn't security focused - submit it anyway!

Check out the talks we had <a href="http://2018.conference.techexeter.uk/" target="_blank">last year</a>.
