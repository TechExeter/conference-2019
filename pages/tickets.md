Our tech  + digital communities have grown immensely over the past four years, and we're proud to have kept our costs low. Any profit we make from this event goes back into the community (part of our Community Interest Company <a href="/about">mission statement</a>).

**Reduced Cost Tickets**<br/>
If you are from a disadvanted background or are a poor student, then we have a limited number of reduced cost tickets available. These tickets have been kindly funded by community donations and by our sponsors. *If you need more assistance to be able to attend the conference, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/about#contact">drop us a message</a>*
