Our tech  + digital communities have grown immensely over the past four years, and we're proud to have kept our costs low. Any profit we make from this event goes back into the community (part of our Community Interest Company <a href="/about">mission statement</a>).

{: .notice--warning} 
**Reduced Cost Tickets**<br/>
For those from disadvanted backgrounds or on a low income, we have a limited number of reduced cost tickets available for you. These tickets have been kindly funded by community donations and by our sponsors. *If you need more assistance to be able to attend the conference, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/about#contact">drop us a message</a>*

[ Tickets are coming very soon! Please check back tomorrow. ]
