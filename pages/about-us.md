TechExeter <em>(and it's sister community Digital Exeter)</em> are community groups, driven by a passionate volunteer leadership team. Entirely self-funded as a CIC, we champion all things Tech and Digital in the region. All the money we raise goes back into supporting the community.

We:

* Put on free <a href="https://meetup.com/techexeter" target="_blank">monthly meetups</a> ranging between 30-100 people
* Help people to run special interest events, e.g. VR / AR demo nights at the University of Exeter
* Run the Exeter site for the global <a href="https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/exeter" target="_blank">NASA SpaceApps Hackathon</a>
* Put on the <a href="https://gameplay.techexeter.uk" target="_blank">GAME>PLAY gaming festival</a>
* Exhibit at events like the Big Bang Fair, VentureFest 
* Work closely on your behalf with Exeter City Council, ExIST, Tech South West and Tech Nation UK
* Support other local interest groups such as PRISM, Alexa Meetup, Python Meetup, Net Squared
* Support our neighbouring communities in Plymouth, Cornwall, North Devon, Somerset, Bristol and Bath
* Are championing <a href="https://techexeter.uk/diversity-and-inclusivity/">diversity and inclusivity</a> 
* Putting tech careers in front of young people via <a href="https://techexeter.uk/tag/education/">outreach into education</a>
