TechExeter <em>(and it's sister community Digital Exeter)</em> are community groups, driven by a passionate volunteer leadership team. Entirely self-funded as a CIC, we champion all things Tech and Digital in the region. All the money we raise goes back into supporting the community.

We:

* Put on free <a href="https://meetup.com/techexeter" target="_blank">monthly meetups</a> ranging between 30-100 people
* Help people to run special interest events, e.g. VR / AR demo nights at the University of Exeter
* Run the Exeter site for the global <a href="https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/exeter" target="_blank">NASA SpaceApps Hackathon</a>
* Put on the <a href="https://gameplay.techexeter.uk" target="_blank">GAME>PLAY gaming festival</a>
* Exhibit at events like the Big Bang Fair, VentureFest and have close links with Exeter City Council, ExIST, Tech South West and Tech Nation UK
* Support our neighbouring communities in Plymouth, Cornwall, North Devon, Somerset, Bristol and Bath
* Are championing diversity - keep an eye out for our <a href="https://techexeter.uk/tag/diversity/">diversity</a> initiatives!
