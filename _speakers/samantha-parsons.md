Note: This is a workshop session

In this immersive table top exercise led by the South West Regional Cyber Crime Unit, you’ll work in teams to manage the cyber security of a fictional organisation, competing against others in the process. You’ll face scenarios based on real life cyber threats, which will develop and evolve as the exercise goes on. You’ll need to use your leadership, communication and collaborative expertise to collectively decide how to protect your reputation, assets and profit.

Also, your company is made of Lego! 
 
The session will teach you how to effectively prioritise different technical, procedural, and physical controls that your organisation can employ to enhance your cyber security. You will also improve your ability to communicate about cyber security to internal and external stakeholders.
