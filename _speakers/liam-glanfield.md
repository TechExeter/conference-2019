Note: This is a workshop session, be sure to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhKUMymab32hHXFB-yqV-d1LaeXADM6LfdL0F9srh2Gfr5DA/viewform?usp=sf_link">register your interest</a>

This talk will give an individual with an IT background an introduction to the common approaches threat actors take to compromise a business and their systems. This includes sharing some of my experiences and stories giving examples of how the attack vectors were realised.

{: .notice--info}
**A threat actor** – compared to a hacker or attacker – does not necessarily have any technical skill sets. They are a person or organization with malicious intent and a mission to compromise an organization’s security or data. This could be anything from physical destruction to simply copying sensitive information. It is a broad term and is intentionally used because it can apply to external and insider threats, including missions like hacktivism.

The talk will then be followed by an optional <strong>workshop</strong> allowing you to understand (and try out for real) the attack vectors in greater depth on our test network.
