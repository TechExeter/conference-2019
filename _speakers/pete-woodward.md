Far too many businesses are unaware that it is mandatory to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) if they accept credit card payments.   This is a huge blind-spot and it is putting businesses in the South West at risk of attack. Many organisations are under the misguided belief that using PCI compliant payment providers such as Sagepay, Stripe or Worldpay confers PCI compliance on their business. 

Businesses failing to comply with PCI DSS are at risk of large fines, and the very real prospect of an inability to trade, should payment providers terminate their service due to non-compliance, or more seriously, experience a card breach

In this discussion Pete will look at some examples of how some recent breaches have happened and what simple controls could have been put in place to prevent them.
