We're proud to have Lucy return to the conference, not as a speaker this time but a track host, looking after the DEVELOP track. 

<h3>Bio</h3>
Lucy is Lead Data Scientist at the Food Standards Agency, and cofounder of the Open Data Institute node ODI Devon and tech start-up The Data Pace. 

She worked first in fine arts and then in opto-electronics manufacturing, where she developed an interest in data analysis and information management, moving into public sector performance and policy management in 2001. She held various roles at Devon County Council, including Open Data Lead, before moving to the Civil Service in 2018 to take on her current post.

Building on her experience of working at the extreme ends of the technical/creative spectrum, she advocates for better communication between technical and non-technical groups and the importance of making technological advances both useful and accessible. Lucy is a regular facilitator and speaker at open data and transformation events, conferences and unconferences across the country.
