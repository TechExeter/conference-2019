This talk will be a somewhat expanded version of the 2018 lightning talk that was given at a Tech Exeter meet up evening - it will provide a short overview of GPS along with an introduction to its vulnerabilities.  

Following this, a series of real-world incidents will be presented along with the known impacts on user systems.  Incidents will include known GPS jamming and spoofing incidents as well as segment errors and the week number roll over issue  that has already caused some disruption to systems in April 2019.  

The presentation will also highlight the importance of putting into place an effective risk mitigation strategy and how to use it to provide cost effective risk mitigation against some of the threat vectors.
