There is a real and present skills shortage in the cyber security industry. 
Currently, there are some amazing young people undertaking computer science and information security degrees, but when they enter the workforce they still lack the business insight that comes with experience. They also tend, very generally, towards a certain demographic (approximately only one in five, for example, are women), and most are very young. 

Bringing these young people into the sector is great and should be encouraged, but it is also a problem in several ways: we already have a skills shortage and the failure to widen the net is giving us a reduced pool of potential candidates. We also end up with people whose experience of life and the world is very similar. 

In this session, we will explore how threats are better mitigated when you have people from a range of ages and backgrounds looking out for them. We will also consider how we can encourage more people into the industry, especially those who currently might feel it is not for them. In particular, we will look at some of the most valuable transferable skills that we should be looking out for.
