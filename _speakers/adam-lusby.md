<h3>Bio</h3>
Adam Lusby joined the University as a full-time member of staff in June 2018. Previously, Adam was an Honorary Senior Research Fellow at the Business School. He is an architect by training and this has led him to focus on the emerging circular economy which he came to through applying the design methodology of McDonough and Braungart’s, ‘Cradle to Cradle’. 

Adam is interested in the 'thinking' that exists on the 'edge' which has led him to work across disciplines and sectors with a curiosity around technology (physical, social, digital, and biological), complexity, and the ideas emerging from the fourth industrial revolution. He currently advises on circular economy, curates and develops content on the Exeter MBA, and he’s working to deliver projects in the areas of entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity in line with the Business School's growth strategy.
