Note: This is a workshop session

This talk will give an individual with an IT background an introduction to the common approaches threat actors take to compromise a business and their systems. This includes sharing some of my experiences and stories giving examples of how the attack vectors were realised. 

The talk will then be followed by an optional <strong>workshop</strong> allowing you to understand (and try out for real) the attack vectors in greater depth on our test network.
