<h3>Bio</h3>
My journey into a digital career has evolved from my love of science, nature, working with people and having an inquisitive mind keen to learn new things.

After leaving university with a degree in Biochemistry and an aspiration to move into scientific and technical writing I worked as a journalist, and then as a News Editor running a news desk of teams of reporters and photographers, on weekly and daily newspapers in the regional press in the South West of England for a little over 10 years.  At the same time I ran a series of successful fundraising campaigns in collaboration with charities and our local community for much needed outreach cancer care nurses to support the terminally ill and mobile Life Education classrooms for children aged 5 – 10 to learn about sex education, drugs and alcohol in a responsible way to help them prepare for adult life. 

I moved on from journalism into a marketing and product focussed role to gain more experience of running campaigns, managing customers and portfolios of products, organising conferences and creating digital services, and studied part-time to gain a post graduate degree in marketing with the Chartered Institute of Marketing. 

From here I joined the UK Hydrographic Office in Taunton, initially working in the Corporate Communications department before taking on various roles in developing and delivering digital products and services to market.  I’ve been at the UK Hydrographic Office for 11 years now and I’ve had the opportunity to grow my experience and evolve my career over that time, which is how I ended up in the Product Owner role I have today. 

My role is part of a team working with digital tools and technologies to create services to gather, process, store and serve up marine data from all over the world so it can used to help people manage, live and work within the marine environment.  The data we work with is geospatial, which means it’s three dimensional to capture the geographical location (north, south, east, west) and vertical depth and height of information about the world’s oceans, tides, marine life, coastlines and manmade structures such as offshore wind turbines and fish farms. 

More details about my digital, technology and STEM journey are in this Blog here, which I was asked to write as part of a global campaign run by Geeky Girl Reality to profile inspirational female role models working in STEM careers: <a href="https://www.geekyreality.com/blog/stemstories-tamsin-product-owner-england/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.geekyreality.com/blog/stemstories-tamsin-product-owner-england/</a>
