<p>In this session, I will highlight how our brain scaffolds our perception of the world around us, with a particular focus on how our experience of objects' properties can be readily manipulated. I'll describe my research on weight illusions, including recent work I have undertaken using immersive virtual reality to make objects feel heavier or lighter than they actually are.</p> 
<p>Finally, I'll lay out a roadmap for how it is a better understanding of human perception, rather than advances in computing hardware, which will be key to the next generation of immersive technologies.</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I received my PhD in psychology from the University of Aberdeen in 2008, after which time I moved to Canada to work as a postdoctoral fellow at the Brain and Mind Institute at Western University. During this time, I began to study human visual and haptic perception, with a particular focus on our experience of how heavy things feel when we interact with them.</p>
<p>I moved to the University of Exeter in 2016, and am currently a senior lecturer in the Department of Sport and Health Sciences.</p>
