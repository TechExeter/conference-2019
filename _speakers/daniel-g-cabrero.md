Personas are representatives of a group of users of a service or product. Anti-personas in design can be used as the representation of undesired users such as wicked users, mischievous hackers and other perverse people we want to prevent and/or stop using / entering our technological world. 

This session focuses on how to think about all and every possibility of stopping every possible anti-persona; create, develop and ground such personas, and so assist the range of (internal/external) stakeholders to have their core, secondary, and future interests covered from the viewpoint of policy and security – from policy and anti-fraud teams, to architects and system engineers, as well as senior stakeholders and external users that may otherwise be, for example, hacked their personal or financial details. 

This talk is presented, narrated and illustrated using filmic narrative as a prompt to building upon the engineering, design, deployment and maintenance of technology, from an open and closed data perspective, and with personas identified as the goodies, the baddies, the omnipresent narrator, secondary and neutral characters, and the usage of props among others themes to draw on.
